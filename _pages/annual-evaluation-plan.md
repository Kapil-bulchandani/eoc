Published Annual Evaluation Plans describe the evaluation activities an agency plans to conduct in the fiscal year indicated by the plan. The plans include "significant" evaluations related to the learning agenda and any other "significant" evaluation, such as those required by statute. Each agency defines how to determine significant evaluations, but most reflect factors such as the importance of a program or funding stream to the agency mission; the size of the program in terms of funding or people served; and the extent to which the study will fill an important knowledge gap regarding the program, population(s) served, or the issue(s) that the program was designed to address.
