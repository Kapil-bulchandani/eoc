The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ("Evidence Act"), signed into law on January 14, 2019, emphasizes collaboration and coordination to advance data and evidence-building functions in the Federal Government by statutorily mandating Federal evidence-building activities, open government data, and confidential information protection and statistical efficiency. Title I of the Evidence Act requires the 24 CFO-Act agencies to designate Evaluation Officers, develop strategic evidence-building plans, and conduct capacity assessments, among other requirements to further evidence-building activities. This page serves as a central home for these plans and requirements.
