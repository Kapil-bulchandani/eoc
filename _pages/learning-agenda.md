title: Learning Agenda

Learning Agendas are systematic plans for identifying and addressing priority questions relevant to the programs, policies, and regulations of an agency. They identify, prioritize, and establish strategies to develop evidence to answer important short- and long-term strategic questions (i.e., questions about how the agency meets its mission(s), including about how programs, policies, and regulations function both individually and in combination) and operational questions (i.e., questions about the agency's operations like human resources, grant-making procedures, financial systems and tracking, and internal processes). Learning agendas should be iterative, flexible, transparent, and tailored to both meet an individual agency's needs and address agency-specific challenges to developing evidence.
